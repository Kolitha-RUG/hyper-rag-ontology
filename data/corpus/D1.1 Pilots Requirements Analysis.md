## Agriculture Pilot

Agriculture pilot initiates a pioneering solution for the high-performance sustainable management of old vineyards that enables effective collaboration between humans and AI/robotics. This solution undergoes validation and demonstration across crucial vineyard management activities, including regular vineyard monitoring (assessing the condition of soils and grapevines), implementing corrective actions (adjusting irrigation patterns, managing nutrient supply, controlling diseases and pests), and determining grape maturity to plan the optimal harvesting time. Additionally, the project will focus on field phenotyping—the ongoing analysis of vine phenotypes using digital imagery and grape leaf processing—to verify grape authenticity and preserve the vineyards' cultural heritage. The solution aims for humans and AI/robots to collaborate seamlessly on these tasks to ensure top-notch vineyard management. The primary goal of this specific pilot is to investigate how human workers could work alongside AI/robots in performing these activities. Depending on the specific circumstances and conditions affecting both humans and AI/robots, various work-sharing strategies will be implemented to optimize the management of these age-old vineyards at QDC, while also enhancing the working conditions for humans involved. The experiment seeks to reduce the physical stress on workers, typically caused by standing all day or performing repetitive tasks, while simultaneously enhancing the consistency of wine production and lowering the mortality rate of the vineyards.
