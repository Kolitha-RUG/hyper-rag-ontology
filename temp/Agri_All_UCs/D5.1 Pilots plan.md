# Pilot 6 – Agriculture

## Pilot Introduction

Viticulture is an important source of employment in Portugal. However, the growing lack of human labour to manage vineyards effectively has become a concern., namely in the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR), the oldest demarcated wine region in the world. Managing a vineyard requires a significant investment of workers’ time and energy.

This is a problem because human labour is essential in this region, where a mountain viticulture is practiced, that is, where the vineyards are located on steep slopes, in which modern machinery cannot manoeuvre.

In this sense, the intent of this agricultural pilot is to reduce workers’ physical stress to make this trade more attractive while, at the same time, to improve the consistency of grapes / wine production and to reduce the grapevine mortality rate. For this, a novel solution for high-performance sustainable management of the old, terraced vineyards of Quinta do Crasto (QDC), is expected to be developed that will be supported on advanced trustworthy digital technologies.

The goal is to: i) ensure that human workers remain central to the process, with AI and robotics serving as tools to enhance their capabilities; ii) use AI and robotics to assist personnel in their tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy; iii) use leverage data and AI insights to help workers make more informed decisions about vineyard management.

## Description of Use Cases

### UC-AGR-1: Identification of grape varieties in Quinta do Crasto’s old vineyards

**Objective:**

To accelerate the preservation of old vineyards, this approach will use human-centred digital twins, AI-powered decision support, and explainability mechanisms to identify all grape varieties. The system will operate during the summer, assisting workers by performing tasks during the hottest hours of the day. Autonomous drones will play a key role in this process, enabling efficient data collection by covering large vineyard areas quickly and ensuring consistent, high-quality imagery for AI analysis. Preserving this terroir is only possible through the identification of its varietal diversity. Since some grapevines are expected to die due to their advanced age, this identification process ensures that each lost vine can be replaced with a genetically identical one, maintaining the vineyard's unique characteristics.

**Scenario:**

In this use case, vineyard conditions will be analysed, and grape varieties will be identified based on collected photographic data. Leaf morphology, a critical factor in varietal identification, will be assessed primarily using images captured from drones but may also be provided by other data sources, such as ground-based cameras or mobile devices. The collected data includes leaf images for morphological analysis, which are essential for varietal identification. The AI-powered classification models process these images and function as an extension of the researcher’s vision, assisting in the identification of grape varieties. The decision support system ensures transparent, explainable predictions, allowing vineyard experts to validate AI recommendations. When uncertainty arises (e.g., overlapping vines or difficult classifications), task-sharing mechanisms will shift the task to a human expert for final verification.

**Key Requirements:**

- The identification of grape varieties shall be transparent, explainable, and validated by human experts through a context-aware decision support system (Shall).
- Task planning shall balance AI-driven automation and human intervention when uncertainty is high, while also ensuring that worker presence data is acquired and used to adjust operations accordingly to maintain safety (Shall).
- A digital twin shall manage grape variety data, ensuring traceability and supporting autonomous vineyard operations (Shall).
- Varietal identification data shall be provided in a GIS-compatible format to enable direct integration into Quinta do Crasto’s management system.

### UC-AGR-2: Monitoring of remote steep-slope vineyard plots

**Objective:**

Enhancing vineyard management through AI-driven monitoring and decision-making that provides accurate insights into key vineyard conditions. By automating data collection and analysis, the system minimizes manual labour, particularly in hard-to-reach areas such as QDC’s old vineyards. The integration of drones and other sensing technologies ensures comprehensive and timely data acquisition, enabling precise assessments of vine health, environmental conditions, and weather-related risks.

**Scenario:**

A monitoring system analyses vineyard conditions in remote steep-slope vineyard plots, where traditional monitoring is difficult and labour-intensive. Using multispectral imaging and environmental sensors, drones and other data sources capture information on vine vigour, air temperature, humidity, radiation, precipitation, and wind speed. Data processing algorithms detect trends, identify anomalies, and support routine vineyard monitoring, phenology tracking, and post-weather event assessments (e.g., after heatwaves or heavy rainfall).

**Key Requirements:**

- Vineyard conditions - including environmental factors and vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, SAVI) — shall be collected, analysed, and integrated into a site-wide assessment using drone imagery and sensor data (Shall).
- A digital twin shall manage vineyard monitoring data, supporting predictive environmental analysis and long-term vineyard health assessments (Shall).
- Vineyard monitoring shall be explainable and validated by human experts through a decision support system that integrates AI-driven analytics for detecting environmental anomalies and tracking vineyard health trends over time (Shall).
- Vineyard monitoring data shall be provided in a GIS-compatible format to enable its integration with Quinta do Crasto’s vineyard management system for decision-making (Shall).

### UC-AGR-3: Transport of the grapes in a steep-slope vineyard during the harvest season

**Objective:**

To improve harvest efficiency and worker safety in steep-slope vineyards by integrating AI-powered grape transport and monitoring of worker fatigue. Automation reduces the need for manual carrying of grape boxes, alleviating physical strain, and optimizing harvest operations through intelligent scheduling and adaptive workload distribution.

**Scenario:**

Harvesting grapes in steep-slope vineyards requires workers to manually transport 22 kg boxes up difficult terrain, leading to fatigue and injury risks over 40-50 days of continuous work. To reduce strain, an AI-powered cargo drone will assist with grape transport, reducing the number of manual trips required.

Additionally, workers will wear IoT sensors that track fatigue, repetitive movements, and sun exposure. The system will analyse collected worker fatigue data to optimize task distribution and ensure sustainable harvesting conditions. Fatigue and transport efficiency data shall be integrated into a vineyard management system, allowing vineyard managers to adjust workload distribution as needed.

**Key Requirements:**

- Worker fatigue can be assessed using wearable sensor data, enabling informed adjustments in task scheduling where applicable (Shall).
- The AI system shall dynamically adjust transport task allocation at predefined intervals, ensuring optimized drone dispatch while allowing workers to validate and refine scheduling suggestions based on operational conditions (Shall).
- The system shall provide clear reasoning for its recommendations, ensuring workers understand why breaks or task adjustments are suggested (Shall).
- The system should provide vineyard supervisors with tools to optimize worker allocation and auxiliary equipment use, particularly when labour shortages impact demanding tasks (Should).
- The AI transport scheduling shall prioritize drone dispatch based on worker fatigue levels, harvest rates, and terrain constraints (Shall).
